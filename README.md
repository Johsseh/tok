Tiktok is a free microblogging service that allows registered members to
 broadcast short posts called toks. Tiktok members can broadcast toks and 
 follow other users' toks by using multiple platforms and devices.

 Tiktok contains information you will find valuable. 
 Messages from users you choose to follow will show up on your home page for you to read.
 It’s like being delivered a newspaper whose headlines you’ll always find interesting – 
 you can discover news as it’s happening,
 learn more about topics that are important to you, 
 and get the inside scoop in real time.

 It's a platform wherein users share their thoughts, news, 
 information and jokes in 140 characters of text or less. 
 Tiktok makes global communication cheap and measurable. Profiles are (usually) public — 
anyone in the world can see what you write, unless you elect to make your profile private. 
Users follow "tik" each other in order to keep tabs on and converse with specific people.
